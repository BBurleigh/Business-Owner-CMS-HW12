# Business-Owner-CMS-HW12

## Description 
---
Aside from this being another classwork assignment, the user will utilize a combination of Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL to browse through a database of their employees. Given a list of options, the user may view all factions (departments), mercanary company roles (positions/roles), and all company members (employees). In addition, the user may add a faction, a role, or a member as well as update a member's role. In hindsight, this project should have been titled "RPG Mercenary Guild Owner", but it was not renamed for the sake of the assignments and commit history. 

## Installation
---
The following commands will need to be run in the user's terminal (do not include the numbers before "npm i"):

1) npm i --save mysql2

2) npm i --save inquirer

3) npm i --save dotenv

4) npm i --save console.table
